        <h3>My Coding Journey</h3>

        <p>Hi, my name is Seth and I am a <strong>software developer</strong>. I started my journey into coding in 2021. I taught myself <strong>Python, JavaScript, and HTML</strong> while I worked in my previous field. Quickly, I realized that I loved the <strong>creativity and problem solving</strong> nature of coding. Before I knew it, I was enrolled in an <strong>online, full-stack software development</strong> program at the Coding Dojo!</p>

        <p>My time at the <strong>Coding Dojo</strong> was focused on <strong>understanding, debugging, and building</strong> full-stack web applications. We learned how to do this in 3 languages â€“ <strong>Python, JavaScript, and C#</strong>. After <strong>14 weeks</strong> of immersive learning and with <strong>1000+ hours</strong> of coursework I graduated and received my software development certificate!</p>
