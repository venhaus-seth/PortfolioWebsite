        <h3>The Before Years</h3>

        <p>I was born, raise, and educated in Anchorage, AK. Despite taking a year and half hiatus from college, I graduated from the University of Alaska, Anchorage in 2019 with a Bachelors in Business Administration and a concentration in Property Management. </p>

        <p>I began working for my previous employer - Weidner Apartment Homes - in 2018. I started out as a part-time floating leasing agent while I finished my last year of school. I quickly learned the industry and jumped at the opportunity to transfer to Seattle, WA and pursue the role of property manager.</p>
        <p>While I excelled in the property management industry, I found myself wanted to learn again. After considering a few options, I landed on software development.</p>
